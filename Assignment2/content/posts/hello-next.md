excerpt: Why I picked Next.js for this course project and how the blog works.

I went with Next.js because I wanted the React-based layout experience while still
keeping a markdown-first workflow. Posts live in `content/posts` and are just `.md`
files with front matter.

It’s nice not having to boot a CMS just to write. If I want a new post, I make a file.
